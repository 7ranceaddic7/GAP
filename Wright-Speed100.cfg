//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = Wright-Speed100
	title = Achieve an airspeed of 100 m/s
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical
	
	description = Kurtis Kerman, a friend of Wilbur Kerman, suggests that an airplane, if designed properly, should be able to exceed speeds faster than the fastest ground vehicles, safely. Wright Aeronautical is interested in helping to prove that this dream is possible. Take an air breathing airplane above 2500m but below 5,000m and see if you can set a new manned vehicle speed record of 100 m/s!
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway and fly above 2500m but below 5,000m and exceed 100 m/s in level flight, and then land back at the KSC safely.
	
	notes = Let's get flying! 
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations, you have set a new air speed record of 100 m/s!\n\nYou have justified Kurtis Kerman's theories on high speed air flight, and brought another measure of fame and reputation to Wright Aeronautical, and by extension to SSI Aerospace. Sponsors are starting to ask how they can support the new air speed frontier. Check in at Mission Control to see if Wright Aeronautical has another contract for you!
