//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = Wright-Barnstorm
	title = Barnstorm Jebediah's tool shed!
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical
	
	description = There's an old tool shed near the R&D Center which is owned by Wright Aeronautical to store fuel for the aviation program. Jebediah Kerman thinks it's not only big enough to house an airplane, but even big enough to fly through it. Bill Kerman objected, Bob Kerman protested, and now Jebediah thinks we outta prove it.\n\nHe managed to convince Orville Kerman that the stunt was somehow for science, and now he has the keys to the shed. Grinning, he says he's already moved the fuel tanks to a safer location, and that we are now ready to try!
	
	synopsis = Go barnstorm Jebediah's tool shed near KSC.
	
	notes = Be sure your pilot signs off on the insurance waiver before attempting this one, as it's not covered.
	
	completedMessage = Amazing! You actually managed to fly an airplane through a building!\n\nYour pilot has earned some experience, and your organziation has gained some reputation for the stunt.
