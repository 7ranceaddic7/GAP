//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = Wright-BarnstormIsland
	title = Barnstorm Jebediah's tool shed!
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical
	
	description = Jebediah owns an old tool shed he thinks is big enough that you can fly through it... with an airplane. Wright Aeronautical currently leases it from Jebediah to store fuel for the aeronautics program. He somehow managed to convince Orville Kerman that the stunt was for science, and he now has the keys to the shed.
	
	synopsis = Go barnstorm Jebediah's tool shed near KSC.
	
	notes = Be sure your pilot signs off on the insurance waiver before attempting this one, as it's not covered.
	
	completedMessage = Amazing! You actually managed to fly an airplane through a building!\n\nYour pilot has earned some experience, and your organziation has gained some reputation for the stunt.
