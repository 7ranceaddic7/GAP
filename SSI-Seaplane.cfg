//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = SSI-Seaplane
	title = Build and fly a seaplane!
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace

	description = You've proven the airworthiness of your aircraft so far. But can you modify it or design an aircraft that can land on water? Inigma Kerman of SSI Aerospace is asking you to attempt another aviation first - landing an airplane on water, and taking back off again. He calls the idea a seaplane, and thinks it will really be useful to a number of organizations at KSC if the idea can be proven.

	synopsis = Land a seaplane on the surface of the water at the waypoint, and take off again and land back at KSC runway.

	notes = Your craft must be an airplane that can land on water horizontally and take off again.

	completedMessage = Congratulations on another aviation first! You have propelled SSI to one of the most popular organizations on Kerbin. SSI has credited your account with a share of funds from various investors who are excited about SSI's future.
