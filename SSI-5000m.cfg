//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = SSI-5000m
	title = Fly an airplane to 5000m.
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = Maculator Kerman, SSI's senior field engineer and owner of Kerbal Aircraft Builders, is looking to push aircraft design capabilities to the limit. In association with a local airline, he is offering a reward to any organization that will be the first to achieve a 5000m flying altitude.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway and fly up to 5000m and then land back at the KSC safely.
	
	notes = Enjoy the view, as at this altitude things on teh ground really start to look small!
	
	completedMessage = 5000m and you didn't hit a bird! Great job!\n\nUnfortunatley, hitting a bird was what the last pilot to attemp this challenge said before he spirled out of control from 4500m and left a crater near the Administration Building. As Gene makes preparations to turn the crater into a memorial pond for aviation pioneers, he congratulates you on returning safely and says SSI has another challenge waiting for you back at Mission Control if you're interested.
