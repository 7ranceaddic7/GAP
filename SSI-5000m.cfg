//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = SSI-5000m
	title = Test Flight of Mk1 Crew Cabin to 5000m
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = Our research team has developed a pressurized crew cabin for passenger comfort and for flying to higher altitudes. We need you to take a Mk 1 Crew Cabin up to 5000m and land back at the KSC runway.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane with a Mk 1 Crew Cabin from the runway and fly it up to 5000m and land back at KSC runway.
	
	notes = Hey with this, we can finally unfasten our seat belts and be free to roam about the cabin!
	
	completedMessage = SSI engineers breath a sigh of relief. Nothing exploded (there was an internal betting pool that your pilot was not aware of). With your flight completed, the Mk 1 Crew Cabin has tested successfully!\n\nGene Kerman says KSC Island Tours and KSC Airlines are both asking for your help to service regular flights of passengers using the new crew cabin. Please check in at Mission Control for additional details.
