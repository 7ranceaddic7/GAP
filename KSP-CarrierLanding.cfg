	group = Kerbal Space Program
	agent = Kerbal Space Program

	description = Many say it is impossible. Only a brave few think it can be done. Land an airplane on a boat. A flat top boat. One we've named the KSS Rix.

	synopsis = Perform the first aircraft carrier landing.

	notes = You've practiced lots of times landing paper airplanes on a postage stamp. Now you get to do the real thing and prove it can be done!

	completedMessage = Congratulations on making the first ever aircraft carrier landing!
