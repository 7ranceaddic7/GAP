//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = KSP-2-IslandFlag
	title = KSP: KSC Island Landing
	group = Kerbal Space Program
	agent = Kerbal Space Program

	description = Your survey revealed a number of trespassers were using KSC Island for illegal dumping of snack canisters. KSC Island is in desperate need of a flag which will hopefully serve as a deterrent to future violators. It's time to turn this abandoned airfield base around and bring it up to speed. Planting a flag near the old air tower is required for PR purposes, but more importantly will serve to remind others that we're here to stay, and that we are serious about using the place for KSC operations.

	synopsis = Land on KSC Island and plant a flag of your choice at the base of the old air tower. Fly back and land at KSC runway.

	notes = This requires landing at KSC Island of course. You can use a boat, but we recommend that you go ahead and try flying in. After all, it's an airfield, not a beach resort. Prove to the public that landing on the island is possible, and raise a flag on it re-claiming the island for operational use by the Kerbal Space Center. Then come back and land at the KSC runway, and report back to Gene Kerman at Mission Control.

	completedMessage = Congratulations on landing at KSC Island and planting a flag! Your flag flutter has energized internal efforts to make KSC Island operational again. Head back to Mission Control and report to Gene Kerman for your next assignment.
