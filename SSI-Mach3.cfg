//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = SSI-Mach3
	title = Achieve Mach 3!
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = Inigma Kerman wants you to take an airplane above 2500m but below 20,000m and reach Mach 3. This is not going to be easy as thermal effects are expected at this speed, but achieving it is necessary for the development of a space plane.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway and fly above 2500m but below 20,000m and exceed 1029 m/s in level flight, and then land back at the KSC safely.
	
	notes = Mach 3. The threshold of the flames of fire. Aerodynamic forces will be attacking your plane relentlessly, and unforgivingly. Send a brave pilot who you know will keep his cool in flight.
	
	completedMessage = Mach 3 achieved! Unfortunately the accomplishment was kept classified for a while as the Kerbal Space Program evaulated SSI's data, and like this message, the initial celebration was just as short lived. Regardless, Inigma Kerman says the success comes with some significant funds to keep your pilot quiet for now.
