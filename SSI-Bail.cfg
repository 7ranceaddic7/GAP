//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = SSI-Bail
	title = SSI Aerospace: Jump from an airplane!
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = SSI's safety enginer, Garnerin Kerman believes it's possible to survive jumping out of an airplane in distress using what he calls a "parachute." But he wonders why you would want to jump out of a perfectly good airplane in order to test it? He says if you really want to do this, that you will need to sign a waiver of liability lest he get the rap for a "unsuccessful test."
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane with a pilot an jump volunteer, and fly up to 2000m and then have your volunteer jump out of a perfectly good airplane.
	
	notes = Enjoy the fall! It is recommended that you take Garnerin up on his idea and outfit your Kerbal with a parachute somehow. Else Jebediah Kerman said something about helmets being a perfectly acceptable landing alternative in a pinch.
	
	completedMessage = You jumped out of an airplane and surived! Your volunteer has more guts than most at KSC.
