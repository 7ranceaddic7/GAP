- Help keptin get KAX updated on CKAN (which means I need to learn it too)
- KSC Sea Tours charter to bring a boat to shore waypoint, to sea waypoint, and back. Player encouraged to keep boat at shore waypoint since it would considered a dock for future tours.
- KSC Sea Tours charters to spawn a persistent dock at the shore waypoint.
- SSI contract to test air flight with empty passengers to KSC Island and return.
- Mission progression: SSI test flight, KSC Flight 101, KSC Coast Guard Rescue fishermen (reported distress by Flight 101)
- Kerbal Space Command STS 107 orbital rescue
- Figure out how to spawn without blowing up one of my space shuttles on launch pad or Island.
