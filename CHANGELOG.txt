CONTRACT PACK KNOWN ISSUES:
- Experimental parts remain experimental... forever. Even if you research the part. Work around is to accept declassification contracts. CC #369

CC ENHANCEMENT REQUESTS:
- #351 Final Frontier Integration
- #357 Add support to include .cfg files within a .cfg file for repeat code inclusion - accepted for next CC release
- #359 SpawnVessel Vessel PQS rather than just lat and long? - accepted for CC 1.8.4
- #366 improve Kerbal generation in contracts (SpawnVessel/Crew) - accepted for 1.8.4
- #368 Ability to Accept Negative Value in advanceFunds? - accepted for 1.9.0 with info functions in 1.8.4 see CC #370

CC BUGS DISCOVERED:
- #355/366 SpawnVessel crew not recognized by HasPassengers. Workaround: use name = RandomKerbalName(Random()) in SpawnVessel/Crew and name = @/TourBus.Kerbals().ElementAt(0) in HasPassengers - see BugTest
- #363 possibly related to #350 spawned craft over water spawns on ocean floor and explodes. (work around is to rebuild craft not using command pod for starter piece, not a re-root, a rebuild. entirely.)
- #364 load passengers dialog box not killed if no selection and one recovers craft before accepting passengers. - fixed in 1.8.4
- #369 Experimental Part, when not locked after completing contract, remains Experimental, even when tech is researched later by player - to be fixed in 1.8.4
- #371 UnlockPart freezing game to Mission Control view. Unable to Quit to Menu - fixed in 1.8.4

KSP BUGS DISCOVERED:
- cancelled contracts not removing spawned kerbals on island. via alt f12 but only happens then. not in MC.
- load passengers bug window stays alive if recovered but no option selected
- SpawnKerbal attribute owned=false does not disable Recovery in Space Center view CC #353, caused by KSP bug.

RELEASE TO DO:
- Set minimum CC version in Groups
- Check all contracts for requirements: are they logical and make sense to stock tech tree, or are requirements checking for alternate trees/mods?
- Uncomment dependencies
- Adjust weights for all missions
- Compare rewards and balance
- Fly all missions
- Test random generator limits
- Update CHANGELOG
- Update README

TO DO:
- KSC Island Tours: 3 Hour Tour - investigate passenger unload premature completion. avoid tugboat scenario.
- KSC Island Tours: 3 Hour Tour - recovery optional at Island or KSC.
- Test gender generation in preparation for Flight 1 (see #355 notes or fix in #366) or use new kerbal creation function for 1.8.4
- KSC Island Tours: Flight 1 (Fly 4 tourists over KSC Islands) - use Spawn Kerbal near runway. SpawnVessel a Tour Bus with driver, to help bring them.
- Test random() to consolidate tours and flights
- Release 0.2

- Investigate best method to give players starting parts that have their Experimental flag cleared. (#369 and 371 for SSI-0, SSI-0-KAX, #369 for SSI-Declassification)
- If Command Seats available, prepare all existing tour and charter contracts to pass using Command Seat only craft (spawn kerbals at runway, or in a bus)
- Kerbal Space Program: KSC Island Airfield Preparation Mission (land at KSCI with 2 Kerbals, walk one to Tower control room WP, walk the other to a hangar WP) - nearly done. test hangar waypoint, test control room waypoint.
- SSI Aerospace: Test Flight of Mk1 Crew Cabin to 5000m
- KSC Air Charters Flight A: 2 Crew Rotation (Exchange 2 staff on KSC Island) - DONE! (waiting to be put in sequence)
- KSC Air Charters Flight B: 4 Crew Rotation (Exchange 4 staff on KSC Island)
- Relase 0.3

- KSC Coast Guard Rescue Fishermen Contract: Random spawn vessel location? (see Whitecat106 Maritime pack) use random() from CC wiki
- Save fishing vessel with light on for night missions.
- Test #350 Spawning on water causes Kerbals or vessels to reappear at ocean floor sometimes - working on testing this one out
- Help keptin get KAX updated on CKAN (which means I need to learn it too)
- convert all lat/long to pqs for RSS compatibility
- lighten the color blue on the Island Tours flag
