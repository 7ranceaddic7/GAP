CC BUGS DISCOVERED:

KSC BUGS DISCOVERED:
- cancelled contracts not removing spawned kerbals on island. via alt f12 but only happens then. not in MC.
- load passengers bug window stays alive if recovered but no option selected


TO DO:
- Test Air Charter A (flesh out Not parameter use)
- Rescue Fishermen make code format consistent with Air Charter A
- SSI Aerospace: First Flight (KAX aware)
- Test Take Command mod to see if SpawnCrew will work to spawn Kerbals in Command Seats.
- KSC Island Tours: Shoreline Tour (to waypoint and back) (see Whitecat106 Maritime pack)  *might defer this to Maritime entirely*
- KSC Coast Guard Rescue Fishermen Contract: Random spawn vessel location? (see Whitecat106 Maritime pack)
- Help keptin get KAX updated on CKAN (which means I need to learn it too)
