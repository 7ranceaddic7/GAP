//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = Wright-FirstFlight
	title = Build and fly your first airplane!
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical

	description = Wilbur and Orville Kerman have been overseeing SSI's flying machine project, and have formed a new venture company called Wright Aeronautical to explore the frontiers of powered air flight. Thanks to your organizations research efforts, we have finally developed an air-breathing engine capable of throttling its power, making controlled powered air flight possible!\n\nPrevious attempts to use solid rockets for airplanes often ended in disaster and a scarcity of willing volunteers.  Wright Aeronautical is asking you to partner with them to build and test a flying machine using the new engine. Your flying machine must have wings so it can control its flight, and be able to land safely.\n\nThis is a whole new frontier where many have failed before, so there isn't any investment money avaialble to offer you at the moment. Wright Aeronautical is willing to cover labor costs, and SSI will cover snacks, however, you will need to put forth your own funds to acquire the parts necessary for this project.

	synopsis = It's time to construct a flying machine - one that will prove to the world that controlled powered air flight is indeed possible!

	notes = Wilbur and Orville both wanted to go, but the coin they flipped landed on its side - hence the reason why they're also asking you to put up a volunteer to pilot the contraption.

	completedMessage = You did it! Your historic flight has spured the imaginations of Kerbals everywhere, and really given your organization a major reputation boost. It has also unlocked a number of opportunities for you at Mission Control. Check back in when you're done celebrating your achievement!
