//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = Wright-FirstFlight
	title = Build and fly your first airplane!
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical

	description = Wilbur and Orville Kerman have been overseeing SSI's secret development of a flying machine, and have formed a new venture company called Wright Aeronautical to explore the frontiers of powered air flight. Thanks to your efforts, SSI Aerospace has finally developed an air breathing engine that throttles, which Wright Aeronautical is quite happy to put to immediate use! This means the dream of controlled powered airflight is soon to become a reality!\n\nPrevious attempts to use solid rockets for airplanes often ended in disaster and a scarcity of willing volunteers. The two brothers are asking you to partner with them to help build and test an airplane that actually flies - and certainly one that doesn't rely on solid rockets. Your flying machine must have wings so it can control its flight and land safely.\n\nThis is a whole new frontier where many have failed before, so unfortunately there isn't any investment money on standby to offer you at the moment. Wright Aeronautical is willing to cover labor costs, and SSI will cover snacks, however, you will need to put forth your own funds to acquire the parts necessary for this project.

	synopsis = It's time to construct a flying machine, but this time one that will prove to the world that controlled powered air flight is possible!

	notes = Wilbur and Orville both wanted to go, but the coin they flipped landed on its side - hence the reason why they've drafted a volunteer from your organization to pilot the machine.

	completedMessage = Great job! Launching rockets is easy. Flying planes is another matter. There were some at the Kerbal Space Center who didn't think you'd even make it off the ground, and if they did, no one thought you'd be able to land mostly intact. An historic first flight for sure!\n\nThis great accomplishment has spured the imaginations of Kerbals everywhere, and has certainly put your oragnization on the top of the attraction list at the Kerbal Space Center. Furthermore, the Kerbal Space Program itself already has plans to use your flying machine and others you develop, if you're interested. Head back over to Mission Control to see what Gene Kerman has to offer you next.
