//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = Wright-FirstFlight
	title = Build and fly your first airplane!
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical

	description = Thanks to your efforts, the SSI Aerospace engineering cooperative has finally developed an air breathing engine that throttles! This means the dream of controlled powered airflight may be possible. Previous attempts to use solid rockets for airplanes often ended in disaster and a scarcity of willing volunteers. Wilbur and Orville Kerman who have been overseeing SSI's development of a flying machine, have formed a new venture company called Wright Aeronautical to explore the technology's application in powered air flight. They are asking to partner with you to help build and test a new airplane - but one without solid rockets, and has wings so it can control its flight and land safely.\n\nSince this is a new idea where many have failed before, there isn't any investment money at the moment to offer you to help make this happen, except for SSI's standard advance which only covers snacks for the project. You will need to put forth your own funds to acquire the parts necessary, and work with Wright to construct a flying machine that can prove to the world that this dream is possible.

	synopsis = Build and fly your first airplane from the runway. Requires wings and an engine no solid fuel aboard. Simply fly up into the air and land safely.

	notes = Wilbur and Orville both wanted to go, but the coin they flipped landed on its side - hence the reason why they've drafted a volunteer from your organization to pilot the machine.

	completedMessage = Great job! Launching rockets is easy. Flying planes is another matter. There were some at the Kerbal Space Center who didn't think you'd even make it off the ground, and if they did, no one thought you'd be able to land mostly intact. An historic first flight for sure!\n\nThis great accomplishment has spured the imaginations of Kerbals everywhere, and has certainly put your oragnization on the top of the attraction list at the Kerbal Space Center. Furthermore, the Kerbal Space Program itself already has plans to use your flying machine and others you develop, if you're interested. Head back over to Mission Control to see what Gene Kerman has to offer you next.
