				description = The waters off of KSC can be treacherous in rough weather. The KSC Coast Guard has a need to deploy a few navigation buoys to help surface vessels find their way home in a storm. The buoys will contain a barometer to provide data to KSC scientists on much needed weather information so we can better inform local surface vessels of impending storms.\n\nLt. Dan Kerman wants you to take Ens. Ro Kerman to supervise the drop and afterwards collect science data from any of the deployed buoys on the surface of the water.\n\nCapt. Flip Kerman will release designs for the KSC Coast Guard Buoys we typically use for these missions if you accept this mission. These plans are dependent on you having researched a number of technologies, none of which we've checked your organization for, however, if you find you can't use the plans, you are welcome to build your own buoys with the technology you currently have access to. Unfortunately we will not be able to provide you access to government researched technology. All buoys dropped for this mission must contain a single barometer each.\n\nTo complete the mission, you probably will also need to include a transmitter on each of your buoys to collect the required science.
				synopsis = KSC Coast Guard: Our motto is Always Ready - Kemper Keratus!
				completedMessage = Mission Completed! Ens. Ro Kerman was very impressed with your handling of the operation. A lot of work for sure, but worth it in the long run as it will hopefully save lives.\n\nYour reputation for completing complex missions is reaching the highest levels of the Coast Guard Command. Be sure to check in at Mission Control for any new missions.

				description = Wilbur and Orville Kerman have been overseeing SSI's flying machine project, and have formed a new venture company called Wright Aeronautical to explore the frontiers of powered air flight. Thanks to your organizations research efforts, we have finally developed an air-breathing engine capable of throttling its power, making controlled powered air flight possible!\n\nPrevious attempts to use solid rockets for airplanes often ended in disaster and a scarcity of willing volunteers.  Wright Aeronautical is asking you to partner with them to build and test a flying machine using the new engine. Your flying machine must have wings so it can control its flight, and be able to land safely.\n\nThis is a whole new frontier where many have failed before, so there isn't any investment money avaialble to offer you at the moment. Wright Aeronautical is willing to cover labor costs, and SSI will cover snacks, however, you will need to put forth your own funds to acquire the parts necessary for this project.
				synopsis = It's time to construct a flying machine - one that will prove to the world that controlled powered air flight is indeed possible!
				completedMessage = Congratulations! Your have achieved an historic flight and have spured the imaginations of Kerbals everywhere.
				notes = Wilbur and Orville both wanted to go, but the coin they flipped landed on its side - hence the reason why they're also asking you to put up a volunteer to pilot the contraption.

				description = Your airplane has passed its airworthiness trials. Gene Kerman of the Kerbal Space Program is asking if your organization would be willing to fly a brave pilot over the KSC Islands and survey the old airstrip constructed on the big island a few years ago. The airstrip was used for testing solid rocket powered airplanes (they weren't very successful, hence why it was abandoned) but is now mainly used as a dumping ground for failed space center projects. \n\nGene thinks it might be possible to clean up the landing strip and make it useable again, but before they can send in a crew to do so, they need an aerial survey performed to ensure it's safe to land there.\n\nSpeaking of landings, Gene insists you continue landing back on the KSC Runway in the hopes that it will raise public awareness of the need for a better runway in the future. You may only use an airplane, helicopter, or VTOL aircraft.
				synopsis = For science (and a few funds)!
				completedMessage = Island survey complete! Your survey confirms it looks safe for a landing in the future. Gene says to head back to Mission Control for a new assignment. He also says that KSC Island Tours is interested in having you repeat your previous flight, but this time with paying passengers if you're interested.

				description = Your survey revealed a number of trespassers were using KSC Island for illegal dumping of snack canisters. KSC Island is in desperate need of a flag which will hopefully serve as a deterrent to future violators. It's time to turn this abandoned airfield base around and bring it up to speed. Planting a flag near the old air tower is required for PR purposes, but more importantly will serve to remind others that we're here to stay, and that we are serious about using the place for KSC operations. You may only use an airplane for this mission.
				synopsis = Land on KSC Island and plant a flag of your choice at the base of the old air tower. Take off and land back at KSC.
				completedMessage = Congratulations on landing on KSC Island and planting a flag! Your flag flutter has energized internal efforts to make KSC Island operational again. Head back to Mission Control and report to Gene Kerman for your next assignment.
				notes = This requires landing on KSC Island of course. You can use a boat, but we recommend that you go ahead and try flying in. After all, it's an airfield, not a beach resort. Prove to the public that landing on the island is possible, and raise a flag on it re-claiming the island for operational use by the Kerbal Space Center. Take off and land back at KSC, and then report to Gene Kerman at Mission Control.
