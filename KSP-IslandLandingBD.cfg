//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = KSP-IslandLandingBD
	title = Operation: Manley Freedom
	group = Kerbal Space Program
	agent = Kerbal Space Program

	description = Gene Kerman says that a rogue group of snack hoarders calling themselves the Hackestream Brigade have kidnapped Scott Kerman and hijacked the KSC Island Airfield. They say the island is theirs now, and to protect their cache of snacks, they threaten to shoot down any plane that comes near the island. They also insist on forcing Scott Kerman to make broadcasts for their cause, but verbal analysis of his "fly safe" tag line has proven that he's being made to do so under duress. Gene says that this course of action by the rogues is unacceptable. He is therefore asking your organization's help to rescue Scott Kerman, and return control of the island back to the Kerbal Space Center, but peacefully if possible. If the beligerents attack you while you attempt a landing, he says you are authorized to defend yourselves and the mission to rescue Scott Kerman, and re-claim the island by any means possible.\n\nThis mission requires that you accomplish each step sequentially, or else something may go wrong and ending might not be a happy one for Scott Kerman or your brave team.
	
	synopsis = First load the KSC intelligence agent from the Tracking Center to assess the situation on the ground at KSC Island, then launch a plane from KSC runway, land on KSC Island, rescue Scott Kerman, and plant a flag of your choice at the base of the old air tower. Then take off and land back at KSC and recover Scott Kerman there.

	notes = You are welcome to use anything and everything in your aresenal to accomplish the mission at hand, including bringing any allies along with you, or running multiple sorties if necessary. Just be sure that before you launch your first flight that you first contact our embedded agent at KSC Island so we can get an updated intelligence report of the situation on the ground.

	completedMessage = The mission was a success! Gene Kerman congratulates you on a successful rescue of Scott Kerman, and the restoring of KSC Island to Kerbal Space Center control. The remaining members of the Hackestream Brigade have escaped for now, but we will continue to seek them out and will hopefully be able to bring them all to justice.
