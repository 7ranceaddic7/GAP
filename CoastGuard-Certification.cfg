//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = CoastGuard-Certification
	title = Coast Guard Rescue Certification
	group = KSC Coast Guard
	agent = KSC Coast Guard

	description = With most money going to the Kerbal Space Program, the KSC Coast Guard often finds itself short on funds for new craft and qualified personnel. We are asking your organization to partner with us to help save lives and bring home what is lost. This is a volunteer contract only, with hazard pay being available only in the most dangerous of missions. We will provide a small advance for fuel and supplies, but what you'll earn mostly by serving is the pride in knowing you are making a difference, and a good reputation for any missions you complete successfully. If you accept, our trained rescue diver and paramedic, Lt. Dan Kerman, will be assigned to help train your volunteers, and will join you on any future missions that you may accept.

	synopsis = KSC Coast Guard: Our motto is Always Ready - Kemper Keratus!

	notes = Rescue Lt. Dan from the deeper waters off the eastern shores of the Kerbal Space Center. Bring him back to land by any means possible to recover him. We recommend that whatever vessel you may choose to employ, that you have grabable rails or a ladder to assist in plucking him from the water.

	completedMessage = KSC Coast Guard Certification Mission Completed!\n\nLt. Dan Kerman thanks you for willingness to volunteer and is impressed with your ingenuity and adaptability to complete the mission. He has now certified your orgnization ready for accepting KSC Coast Guard rescue and retrieval contracts.
