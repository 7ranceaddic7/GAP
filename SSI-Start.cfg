//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = SSI-Start
	title = Join SSI Aerospace!
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = Welcome to SSI Aerospace! We are an engineering cooperative focused on developing aerospace assets for use by the Kerbal Space Program. Based out of the Research & Development Facility at KSC, our partner companies include the Ford Carriage Company, Tesla Electrics, the Wright Bicycle Company, and my own company, Inigma Industries. I'm Inigma Kerman, founder of SSI, and I would like to extend an invitation to your organization to join us!\n\nWe've developed a number of technologies that we need delivered, along with myself, to the R&D Center for the next SSI Aerospace technology conference. If you do this for us, you will get access to our prototypes for use in your own endeavors.\n\nAlthough it's not necessary, please consider installing the Take Command mod by seanmcdougall, and Kerbal Aircraft eXpansion (KAX) by keptin, as these mods will enhance your experience with our development program. You can obtain both of these from CKAN.

	synopsis = Accept this contract to join SSI Aerospace as a partner, and gain access to our technology. To solidfy the deal, simply deliver Inigma Kerman to the R&D center along with a few parts.
	
	notes = With this deal, SSI will profit from your development ingenuity, and you get access to our tech!
	
	completedMessage = The conference was a success! Check in with Mission Control for additional opportunities. Enjoy the new parts!
