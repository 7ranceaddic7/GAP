//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = SSI-0
	title = A Visit with Shuttle Craft Systems Inc.
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = Hello! My name is Inigma Kerman, and I am the founder of SSI Aerospace, a startup engineering cooperative made up of Henry Kerman of the Ford Carriage Company, Nikola Kerman of Tesla Electrics, and Wilbur and Orville Kerman of the Wright Bicycle Company. We are based out of the Research & Development Facility at KSC.\n\nWe develop and explore aerospace technologies and opportunities, and would like to extend an invitation to your organization to join us in the development of aerospace assets for use by the Kerbal Space Program.\n\nWe are the inventors behind the Command Seat, a few structural parts, a powered wheel, and a battery pack for use in assembling electric bikes, cars, and boats - a few of which you may have already seen buzzing around KSC. We are also in the process of developing the first variable control engine in preparation for a secret project that Orville and Wilbur Kerman are working on.\n\nWill you join us and help fund our efforts? We know the investment we are asking from you in terms of your time and money is steep and abitious, but so are the goals we've set for ourselves. We believe that the return on your investment will be worth it in the long run.\n\nIf you decide to accept and join us, we simply need you to pick me up at the Administration building and deliver myself and our current experimental prototypes to the R&D Facility Conference building by this time tomorrow. I am making a presentation on our progress to the rest of the space program and hope to convince them to continue funding our efforts and make more of these parts. If you succeed, you will get to keep the prototypes for yourself. If you fail to deliver me and the parts on time, we stand to lose a lot, and the prototypes will be sold to cover our bills.
	
	synopsis = Join the SSI Aerospace engineering cooperative, make a craft with all the experimental parts, and bring the parts and Inigma Kerman to the R&D facility.
	
	notes = SSI needs your monetary investment and craft development ingenuity. You get access to all our inventions. It's a pretty good deal overall.
	
	completedMessage = Your craft was an amazing piece of engineering, and we've secured our funding! I was wondering how you would fit all those parts together in a neat package. Your organization's engineering talent is exactly what we were looking for, we're happy you've joined the SSI Aerospace cooperative. Enjoy the new parts! We look forward to working with you again very soon!
