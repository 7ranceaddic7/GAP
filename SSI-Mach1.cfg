//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = SSI-Mach1
	title = Break the sound barrier!
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = SSI Aerospace's chief scientist Mach Kerman, and KSP retired test pilot Yeager Kerman, want to push SSI development toward a space plane. To do this, Inigma Kerman says SSI needs your organization to take on the tough challenge of literally breaking into the frontier of supersonic flight. Although not required, Mach Kerman believes that if you can design an airplane to use a liquid fueled rocket engine, it might make this attempt easier to accomplish. Take an airplane above 2500m but below 20,000m and break the sound barrier! Yeager Kerman suggest that you design a plane that can fly itself with minimal input to reduce the chance that over-correction could lead to the destruction of your test plane.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway and fly above 2500m but below 20,000m and exceed 343 m/s in level flight, and then land back at the KSC safely.
	
	notes = No one has ever gone faster than the speed of sound before, so most scientists and engineers are at a loss to give you any useful advice. Even if they could, they're afraid you'd be travelling to fast to hear it anyways.
	
	completedMessage = You have broken the sound barrier and achieved the amazing speed of Mach 1! Don't worry, we're sure it can be fixed back up in a jiffy for the next guy!
