//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = SSI-1-FirstFlight
	title = SSI: Test your first airplane prototype!
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace

	description = Your research program has finally managed to develop and construct an engine that throttles! This means the dream of controlled powered airflight may be possible. Previous attempts to use solid rockets for airplanes often ended in disaster and a scarcity of willing volunteers. Wilbur and Orville Kerman of SSI Aerospace want to partner with you to help turn things around, and build and test a new airplane - but one without solid rockets, and has wings so it can control its flight and land safely.

	synopsis = Launch a brand new airplane prototype from the runway that has wings and an engine not powered by solid fuel, get it up into the air, and land back on the ground without destroying it.

	notes = Wilbur and Orville both wanted to go, but the coin they flipped landed on its side. Hence why your volunteer pilot was choosen.

	completedMessage = Great job! Launching rockets is easy. Flying planes is another matter. There were some at the KSC who didn't think you'd make it off the ground. An historic first flight for sure. It certianly was well worth the effort. Congratulations! Your accomplishment has certainly got the attention of the Kerbal Space Program at KSC. Head back over to Mission Control to see what Gene Kerman has to offer you next.
