//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = Wright-Glider
	title = Build and fly a glider!
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical

	description = Wilbur and Orville Kerman have been overseeing SSI's flying machine project, and have formed a new venture company called Wright Aeronautical to explore the frontiers of powered air flight. To get started, they want you to develop a prototype gilder to test a few flight control concepts. Your glider must only have a Command Seat, wings to control its flight, and be able to land safely.\n\nGetting the glider up into the air is up to your imagination, however Jebediah Kerman recommends the tried and true solid rocket approach. That or jumping off a cliff. Your choice. Whatever you decide to do, just make sure your pilot survives. We don't want any bad publicity so early into our program. To be counted as a true glider, you will need to decouple any boosters you decide to use.

	synopsis = Making a glider isn't that hard. Getting it up off the ground though, will present a challenge.

	notes = Jebediah hints that if you decide to go with a solid rocket launch assist, that you include a means to decouple the solid rockets for a smoother flight.

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Your have achieved an historic flight and have spured the imaginations of Kerbals everywhere.
