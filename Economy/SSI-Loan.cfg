	description = Here at SSI, we take care of our own. We've noticed that you are running low on funds, and would like to extend to you a loan from our Venture Capital Fund to help get your balance sheet back into the positive.
	
	synopsis = Accept this contract to receive a loan equal to half of the amount of your starting funds. This loan is interest free for 30 days, after which we will automatically deduct both the loan payment and a 35% interest charge from your account.
	
	notes = If you pay off this loan before 30 days is up, we will only deduct from your account the amount we lended to you, with no interest charge. To pay this loan off early, just simply cancel the contract.
	
	completedMessage = Your loan has been paid off, but with a 35% interest charge since you waited 30 days to pay us back. We hope you were able to get your financials back in order in the meantime! We'll be here if you need us again in the future.
