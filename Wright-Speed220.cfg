//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = Wright-Speed220
	title = Achieve an airspeed of 220 m/s
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical
	
	description = Kurtis Kerman, now a fellow engineer with Wright Aeronautical, thinks that with current technology, it may be possible to exceed 220 m/s. A number of sponsors have given SSI Aerospace some money to see it happen, and Inigma Kerman is more than happy to funnel all of it to Wright Aeronautical and on to your organization!\n\nAttempting high speed flying though is not for the faint of heart. Some pilots have reported aircraft serious shimmies when approaching high speeds during dives, and often planes are known to break up when exceeding 220 m/s. He wants you to be the first to take an air breathing airplane above 2500m but below 5,000m and see if you can exceed 220 m/s safely in level controlled flight, and give the sponsors a return on their investment.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway and fly above 2500m but below 5,000m and exceed 220 m/s in level flight, and then land back at the KSC safely.
	
	notes = Let's get flying!
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations, you have set a new air speed record of 220 m/s and returned alive!\n\nYour success in meeting Wright Aeronautical challenges has Inigma Kerman calling for you to see if you can surmount one of the most daring airspeed challenges ever conceived: breaking the sound barrier. Check in with Mission Control for details.
